            <p>HTML encoding converts characters that are not allowed in HTML into character-entity equivalents; HTML
                decoding reverses the encoding. For example, when embedded in a block of text, the characters < and> are
                    encoded as &lt; and &gt; for HTTP transmission.</p>

            <p><b>In HTML, a comment is text enclosed within < ! ╌ ╌> tags. This syntax tells the browser that they are
                        comments and should not be rendered on the front end. Thanks to the comments tag, you can leave
                        notes to remind yourself where you left off in the build process</b></p>
