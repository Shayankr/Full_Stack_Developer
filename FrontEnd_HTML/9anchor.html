    <p id="heading">Germans (German: Deutsche, pronounced [ˈdɔɪ̯t͡ʃə] (listen)) are the natives or inhabitants of
        Germany, and sometimes more broadly any people who are of German descent or native speakers of the German
        language.[9][10] The constitution of Germany defines a German as a German citizen.[11] During the 19th and much
        of the 20th century, discussions on German identity were dominated by concepts of a common language, culture,
        descent and history.[12] Today, the German language is widely seen as the primary though not exclusive criterion
        of German identity.[13] Estimates on the total number of Germans in the world range from 100 to 150 million, and
        most of them live in Germany.[14]</p>

    <p id="subheading">The history of Germans as an ethnic group began with the separation of a distinct Kingdom of
        Germany from the eastern part of the Frankish Empire under the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th century, forming the
        core of the Holy Roman Empire. In subsequent centuries the political power and population of this empire grew
        considerably. It expanded eastwards, and eventually a substantial number of Germans migrated further eastwards
        into Eastern Europe. The empire itself was politically divided between many small princedoms, cities and
        bishoprics. Following the Reformation in the 16th century, many of these states found themselves in bitter
        conflict concerning the rise of protestantism. The 19th century saw the dismemberment of the Holy Roman Empire
        and the growth of German nationalism. The kingdom of Prussia incorporated most of the Germans into its German
        Empire in 1871, while a substantial number of Germans also inhabited the multiethnic kingdom of Austria-Hungary.
        During this time a large number of Germans emigrated to the New World, particularly to the United States, Canada
        and Brazil, as well as establishing prominent communities in New Zealand and Australia. The Russian Empire also
        contained a substantial German population.</p>

    <p id="mainheading">In the aftermath of World War I, Austria-Hungary and the German Empire were partitioned,
        resulting in many Germans becoming ethnic minorities in newly established countries. In the chaotic years that
        followed, Adolf Hitler became the dictator of Nazi Germany and embarked on a genocidal campaign to unify all
        Germans under his leadership. This endeavour resulted in World War II and the Holocaust. In the aftermath of
        Germany's defeat in the war, the country was occupied and partitioned. Millions of Germans were expelled from
        Eastern Europe. In 1990, the states of West and East Germany were reunified. In modern times, remembrance of the
        Holocaust has become an integral part of German identity (Erinnerungskultur).</p>
